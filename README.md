# gold-models
3D model files, ported to new graphics engine for [Colobot: Gold Edition](https://colobot.info)

# Layout
Files are sorted into 2 directories:
* models - contains .gltf and .bin files, containing all mesh and material informations
* textures/objects - texture files, used by model files

Both directories can be directly copied into `data` directory of Colobot: Gold Edition >0.2.1, or put as a mod (inside `data/mods/<whatever name>` directory).
